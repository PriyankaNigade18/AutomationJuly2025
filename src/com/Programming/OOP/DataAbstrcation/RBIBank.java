 * Interface
 * ----------------
 * Interface is special class which can have all methods by default
 * public and abstract methods and variable are static and final.
 * 
 * 100% abstraction is possible
 * 
 * We can not create object of interface
 * 
 * To access methods of interface we need child class 
 * & child class has to implement all the abstract methods of interface.
 * 
 * Using interface multiple and hybrid inheritance we can achieve
